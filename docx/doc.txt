False : false is false
[] is false
{} is false

0.0 is false
0 is false
None is false


everything else is True

=================================================


1 - select block of code  ==> [shift + ctrl + alt + t ] ==> for generete methods

2- journal.test() while test not defined at journal ==> alt + enter to create it

3- ctrl + q (f1 for mac) show doc of function

4- ctrl _ shift _ i ==> show implemntation of function

5- what is pycharm lens mode ?
        - how to find errors in code.
        - and potential danger zones
        - keep track of items that need to be finished


6- what is pycharm console
    - python interactive console
    - calc values on the fly

7- pycharm package manager (like pip)

8 pylint , flake8 : code analaysis, quality tools for python
 - running summary & detailed reports about your code

>> pylint section3/ --reports=y

-----------------
9- testing with pycharm:

settings >>  python integrated tools >> testing ( you can chosse testing framework) (default unittests)


10- pycharm templates
>>settings >> templates >> CHOOSE YOUR FILE TEMPLATE [html, css, python, flask, ...]

11- add info for python file by deafault

>> settings >> templates >> python script >> type " create by ${USER} at ${DATE} "
every time you create python file the output looks like (created by Nagaj at 17/04/2021)

11- this outout comes from pycarm varaibles
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/file-template-variables.html#predefined_template_variables

=================================

show doc of method, module using help


from app4_journal.journal import load
help(load)
Help on function load in module app4_journal.journal:
load(name:str) -> List[str]
    if file exist , add entries to data list
    :param name: filename of journal with no extension
    :return: list of journals


========================================

doc string: string with triple qoutes at the beginning of the method, class, module
- this description is used in genereting docs and intellisense


==========================================

print(__file__)  # show fullpath of running file
print(__name__) # show how file excute, file runs as python script (__main__) or python module(__name__ in this case = python module name)

===========================================

Why is the _ _name_ _ variable used?
The __name__ variable (two underscores before and after) is a special Python variable. It gets its value depending on how we execute the containing script.

Sometimes you write a script with functions that might be useful in other scripts as well. In Python, you can import that script as a module in another script.

Thanks to this special variable, you can decide whether you want to run the script. Or that you want to import the functions defined in the script.

What values can the __name__ variable contain?
When you run your script, the __name__ variable equals __main__. When you import the containing script, it will contain the name of the script.

Let us take a look at these two use cases and describe the process with two illustrations.

WHEN YOUR PROGRAMM IS USED BY ANOTHER PROGRAM

===========================================

pypi: python package index.
CHECK live templates from pycharm for shourtcuts
-------------------
packing: store vars to container
t, *others = 12, 4, "Cat", [5, 6, 7]  # using packing  (ربط) بجمع
print(others)  # list of [ 4, "Cat", [5, 6, 7]]
------------------
unpacking: return container like (list, tuple) back to single varaibles
print(*others)  # 4 Cat [5, 6, 7]]  # using unpacking (فك الربط) بفك التجميع
john, james, sara = ("JOHN", "JAMES", "SARA")  # using unpacking
print(john, james, sara)   # JOHN JAMES SARA
================================

check virtual enviroment
>> which virtualenv
OUTPUT : /c/Users/Nagaj/python37/Scripts/virtualenv

--------------------------
$ which python3
/c/msys64/mingw64/bin/python3
-----------------------------
apply ploymorphims using "get_defensive_roll". based on input (SmallAnimal, Dragon, creature, Wizard) you can call
the same method but diffrenet implemntation based on instance ( SmallAnimal, Dragon, creature, Wizard)

==========================
DUCK TYPING

n this lesson, you’ll learn about duck typing. This term comes from the saying “If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.” (There are other variations).

Duck typing is a concept related to dynamic typing, where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. When you use duck typing, you do not check types at all. Instead, you check for the presence of a given method or attribute.

For example, you can call len() on any Python object that defines a .__len__() method:

>>> class TheHobbit:
...     def __len__(self):
...         return 95022
...
...
>>> the_hobbit = TheHobbit()

>>> the_hobbit
<__main__.TheHobbit object at 0x108deeef0>

>>> len(the_hobbit)
95022

>>> my_str = "Hello World"
>>> my_list = [34, 54, 65, 78]
>>> my_dict = {"one": 123, "two": 456, "three": 789}

>>> len(my_str)
11
>>> len(my_list)
4
>>> len(my_dict)
3
>>> len(the_hobbit)
95022

>>> my_int = 7
>>> my_float = 42.3

>>> len(my_int)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
    len(my_int)
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()

not interest in obj type it self , interest in it's actions like duck , ins in how obj (duck) walk, how swim, how talk.
